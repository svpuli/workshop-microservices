# Microservices - is that easy?

Workshop that bootstraps 3 microservices that will search for news and gifs.

## 🤘 Develop

### Installing

Make sure you're logged in into Pipedrive's private NPM by simply run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies in all of the microservices.

### Writing & Running Code

Just run `docker-compose up`. As soon as you do that, we automatically build the application and
start it, while watching for changes in TypeScript source code modified in `src/`.
